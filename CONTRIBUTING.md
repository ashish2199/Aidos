## Ensure that you donot sumbit something that has error or doesn't compile.

1. Donot have absolute path in your code. Always use path relative to project folder.
2. Donot use numbers as arguments, instead declare a variable with appropriate name and assign it the value which you want to pass to the method. If you feel you must then atleast comment above it why you have used that particular number.
3. Add meaningful comments

### Devide your work into a series of commit so that if needed we are able to cherry pick them.
