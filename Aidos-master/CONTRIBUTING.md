# Guidelines

## Ensure that you don't submit something that has an error or doesn't compile.

1. Do not have absolute paths in your code. Always use a path relative to project folder.
2. Do not use numbers as arguments, instead declare a variable with appropriate name and assign it the value which you want to pass to the method. If you feel you must, then atleast comment above it why you have used that particular number.
3. Add meaningful comments

### Divide your work into a series of commits so that if needed we are able to cherry pick them.
